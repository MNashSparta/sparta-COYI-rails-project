## Map
###### File locations

Map file is located in: app/assets/javascripts/map.js
Map container div and related HTML is located in: app/views/home/home.html.erb

###### Functionality

Map uses Google maps API. Currently running with a Spartan's API key (Adam).
Markers are hard-coded in. Any new markers added will currently have to be hard coded in as well.
Map conflicts with turbolinks gem. This is due to turbo links not loading the page properly when switching. Turbo links has currently been disabled. Alternatively a button can be used to refresh the page and show the map.

###### Appearance

Map land is #ffffff a white.
Map background (the sea) is #F0564E the same red as the website

Authentication is handled with a gem called Devise.

For the user to sign up requires :

There are no optional fields.

The password complexity requires at least 1 of each of the following:

It also requires that the password is at least 8 characters long.
The file for this is in: app/models/user.rb in the method "password_complexity".

Password can be reset by going to "login" then clicking the "Forgot my password" button. The email entered must be registered.
